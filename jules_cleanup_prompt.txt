The repository contains unnecessary files and large directories that were accidentally committed.

CRITICAL: Start by switching to the cleanup branch:
`git fetch origin chore/cleanup`
`git checkout chore/cleanup`

Your task is to Clean these up.

Please DELETE the following from the repository:
1. The entire directory `bearded-theme-master/` (and all its contents). This is an external dependency source that should not be in our repo.
2. The file `[Content_Types].xml` in the root (if it exists).
3. The file `extension.vsixmanifest` in the root (if it exists).
4. Any `pnpm-lock.yaml` files (we use `package-lock.json`).

Do NOT touch the `extension/` directory (except for pnpm-lock.yaml), or `README.md`.
We want to keep the root clean, containing only `extension/`, `README.md`, and git/vscode configs.
