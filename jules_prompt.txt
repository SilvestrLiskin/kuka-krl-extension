You are an expert UI/UX Designer and VS Code Extension Developer specializing in Color Theory.

**Objective:**
Perform a "Premium" Color Correction and Formatting Overhaul on ALL 67+ theme files located in `extension/client/themes/`.

**Context:**
This is a KUKA Robot Language (KRL) extension. We have over 60 themes ported from various sources (Bearded Theme, etc.), but their highlighting for KRL specific syntax is generic or lackluster. We need a "Premium" look where colors are vibrant, contrast is perfect, and the code looks professional and "alive".

**Input:**
- Scope Definitions: `extension/client/syntaxes/krl.tmLanguage.json` (Use this to understand what scopes are available).
- Theme Files: `extension/client/themes/*.json`.

**Instructions for EVERY Theme File:**
1.  **Analyze the Theme:** Read the specific JSON theme file to understand its base color palette (background, foreground, existing token colors).
2.  **Generate a Palette:** Create a mapping of KRL elements to colors that MATCH the theme’s aesthetic but pop with "Premium" quality.
    - *Example:* If the theme is "Monokai" (Yellow/Pink/Green), ensure KRL Keywords are Pink, Strings are Yellow, etc.
    - *Example:* If the theme is "Oceanic" (Blue/Teal), ensure distinctive shades that don't wash out.
3.  **Apply Formatting Rules (Mandatory):**
    - **Comment**: `fontStyle: "italic"` (Color: Dimmed/Subtle but readable).
    - **Control Keywords** (`IF`, `WHILE`, `LOOP`, `WAIT`, `HALT`): `fontStyle: "bold"` (Color: Strong/Vibrant).
    - **Storage/Types** (`DECL`, `INT`, `REAL`, `GLOBAL`): `fontStyle: "italic"` (Color: Distinctive).
    - **System Variables** (`$POS_ACT`, `$IN`): `fontStyle: ""` (Color: Critical/Warning-like or Distinctive from normal variables).
    - **Fold Markers** (`;FOLD`, `;ENDFOLD`): `fontStyle: "bold"` (Color: High visibility/distinct).
4.  **Scope Mapping (Ensure these are covered):**
    - `comment.line.fold.krl` (FOLD/ENDFOLD)
    - `comment.line` (General comments)
    - `keyword.control.krl` (Control flow)
    - `keyword.function.movement.krl` (PTP, LIN, CIRC - Critical movement commands, make them POP)
    - `storage.type.krl` (Declarations)
    - `variable.language.system.krl` ($Variables)
    - `constant.numeric.krl` (Numbers)
    - `string.quoted.double.krl` (Strings)
    - `variable.function.krl` (User Functions)
    - `constant.language.enum.krl` (Enums starting with #)
5.  **Output Requirement:**
    - You must modify ALL 67 files.
    - Do NOT output 67 code blocks in the chat. Use your file editing tools to apply changes directly to the files.
    - "Premium" means: High Contrast, Saturation where appropriate, and correct use of Italics/Bold to create visual hierarchy.

**Execution:**
Start by analyzing the `tmLanguage` file, then systematically update every `.json` file in `extension/client/themes/`. Ensure JSON validity is maintained.
