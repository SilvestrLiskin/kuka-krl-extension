MISSION: Implement a "Syntax Fallback" diagnostic in the KRL extension to flag unrecognized lines (random text, gibberish) that do not match any legal KRL pattern.

CONTEXT:
Users can currently enter random text like "klvghj" and the extension does not show any error. This is because our diagnostics in `diagnostics.ts` are based on positive matching of known patterns.

TASKS:
1. Audit `extension/server/src/features/diagnostics.ts`.
2. Implement a new method `validateSyntaxFallback(document: TextDocument): Diagnostic[]` or similar.
3. This method should iterate through lines and flag any line that is NOT:
   - A comment (starts with ;)
   - A FOLD / ENDFOLD
   - A valid declaration (DECL, SIGNAL, STRUC, ENUM, etc.)
   - A valid movement (PTP, LIN, CIRC, SPTP, etc.)
   - A control structure (IF, FOR, WHILE, LOOP, SWITCH, etc.)
   - A valid assignment (e.g., Var = Value)
   - A procedure call (e.g., BAS(...))
   - An empty line
4. Ensure no false positives on complex but valid KRL instructions.
5. Add a "diag.syntaxError" key to `extension/server/src/lib/i18n.ts` with appropriate translations in EN, RU, TR.
6. Integrate this new check into the main validation loop in `extension/server/src/core.ts`.
7. Perform a "Full Scan" of the diagnostics logic to identify and fix other similar gaps.

RULES:
- Follow the project's coding style.
- Use the existing regex system in `diagnostics.ts`.
- Ensure performance is not significantly degraded.
