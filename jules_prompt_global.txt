Task: Global Optimization & Technical Debt Audit for KUKA KRL Extension

Role: Lead DevOps Engineer & Performance Specialist.

Objective: Perform a deep audit and optimization of the entire codebase to improve performance, maintainability, and ensure 100% theme consistency.

Technical Requirements:
1. Performance Optimization (Server):
   - Analyze `extension/server/src/features/diagnostics.ts` and related files.
   - Pre-compile all Regular Expressions used for pattern matching and diagnostics.
   - Optimize workspace root loading to be fully asynchronous and non-blocking.
2. Code Quality & Consistency:
   - Audit all 67 JSON theme files in `extension/client/themes/`.
   - Ensure a unified set of KRL token scopes is supported in every theme (e.g., `meta.fold.krl`, `variable.language.system.krl`, `keyword.function.movement.krl`).
   - Standardize `uiTheme` assignments (vs/vs-dark/hc-black).
3. Technical Debt Cleanup:
   - Resolve all warnings in `extension/package.json` (missing icons, metadata gaps).
   - Identify and remove any dead code or unused assets in the `client` and `server` folders.
4. Testing & Verification:
   - Expand the test suite in `extension/tests/` to include theme validation and performance benchmarks.
   - Ensure the project compiles flawlessly (`npm run compile`).

Deliverables:
- A detailed "Summary of Changes".
- Verification report (compile and test results).
- Mandatory "Prevention" section: Explain how to avoid code debt and performance regression in the future.
