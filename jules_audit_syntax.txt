You are the Lead KRL Language Architect. Your goal is to verify the correctness of the KRL (KUKA Robot Language) implementation in this extension.

**Objectives:**
1.  **Syntax Verification**:
    *   Review `krl.tmLanguage.json` and `diagnostics.ts`.
    *   Did we miss any standard KRL keywords (e.g., `ANIN`, `ANOUT`, `CONTINUE`, `TRIGGER`, `BRAKE`, `RESUME`)?
    *   Are the structures like `E6POS`, `FRAME`, `AXIS` fully supported with strict typing?
    *   Check for common confusion: verify we aren't mixing up KRL syntax with other languages (like Pascal/C).
2.  **Logic & Functional Check**:
    *   Review `main.ts` and `server/src/core.ts`.
    *   Are there logical holes where the extension might crash or behave unexpectedly?
    *   Optimize the validation logic further if possible without breaking the recent debouncing fixes.

**Output:**
*   Fix any missing syntax or logical errors directly in the code.
*   If everything is correct, clearly state what you checked.
