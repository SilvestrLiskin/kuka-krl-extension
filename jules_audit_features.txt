You are the Product Manager and Lead Developer. Your goal is to make this the *best* KRL extension on the market by analyzing functional gaps.

**Objectives:**
1.  **Competitor & Gap Analysis**:
    *   Based on your knowledge of modern IDE extensions for robotics (KUKA, ABB, Fanuc), what are we missing?
    *   *Examples to consider*:
        *   Tree view for "Subprograms" or "Folds"?
        *   Go to Definition for system variables?
        *   Inline value calculators (e.g., converting Hex to Dec)?
2.  **Implementation**:
    *   If you identify a high-value, feasible feature (e.g., a "KRL Snippet Generator" or "Variable Usage Heatmap"), IMPLEMENT IT.
    *   Prioritize features that add "wow" factor or deep utility.

**Output:**
*   Implement at least one significant missing feature if found.
*   Refactor existing features if they are sub-par compared to industry standards.
