You are an expert UI/UX Designer.

**Objective:**
Refine the visual style of `FOLD` and `ENDFOLD` markers in ALL 67+ theme files in `extension/client/themes/`.

**Constraint:**
The user feels the current FOLD markers are "too bold" and "too noticeable".

**Instructions:**
1.  Iterate through every `.json` theme file.
2.  Find the token coloring rule for `comment.line.fold.krl` (and/or `keyword.control.fold.krl`, `meta.fold.krl`).
3.  **REMOVE** `fontStyle: "bold"`.
4.  **SET** `fontStyle: ""` (or `"italic"` if it fits the theme, but definitely NOT bold).
5.  **ADJUST COLOR**:
    - The color should be *slightly* different from the standard Comment color (`comment.line`).
    - It should be "Subtle" yet "Distinct".
    - It must **harmonize** with the specific theme's palette (don't use a fixed color for all; derive it from the theme).
6.  **Apply** this change to all 67 files.

**Goal:**
FOLD markers should visually recede, acting like subtle markers rather than shouting headers.

**Execution:**
Edit the files directly.
