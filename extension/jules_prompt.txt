I have uploaded the original Bearded Theme source files to `extension/bearded-theme-source/` on branch `fix/themes`.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP:
You MUST start by switching to the correct branch, as the files are NOT in main.
Run:
`git fetch origin fix/themes`
`git checkout fix/themes`

Your task is to fix the KRL themes in `extension/client/themes/`.
Currently, these KRL themes have good syntax highlighting (`tokenColors`) but missing UI colors (`colors`), making the editor look default.

For each JSON file in `extension/client/themes/`:
1. Find the corresponding source theme in `extension/bearded-theme-source/`. The names are similar but might not be identical.
   - Example: `KRL_Bearded_arc.json` -> `bearded-theme-arc.json`
   - Example: `KRL_Bearded_arcEolstorm.json` -> `bearded-theme-arc-eolstorm.json`
   - Strategy: Ignore "KRL_" and "Bearded_" prefixes, match the rest case-insensitively or by fuzzy match.
2. Read the `colors` object from the source theme.
3. Merge this `colors` object into the target KRL theme file.
4. DO NOT overwrite `tokenColors` or `name` or `type`. Only update/add `colors`.
5. If a source theme is not found, skip it.

Please fix all matching theme files in a single batch.
