You are an expert VS Code Extension Developer and TypeScript/Node.js specialist.

**Objective:**
Investigate and FIX the issue where "Error Checking/Validation" is completely broken and showing nothing in the editor.

**Context:**
The user reports that the error highlighting (squiggles) and the Problems panel are empty, even when there are obvious errors in the KRL code. This suggests a breakage in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) diagnostics flow or the client-side `krlDiagnostics` collection.

**Related Files:**
1.  `extension/client/src/main.ts`: Client entry point. Sets up `krlDiagnostics` and handles `runSyntaxCheck`.
2.  `extension/server/src/core.ts`: Server entry point. Likely where `validateTextDocument` or similar is called.
3.  `extension/server/src/features/diagnostics.ts`: Contains the `DiagnosticsProvider` logic.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze** `client/src/main.ts` to ensure `runSyntaxCheck` is actually called on document changes and that `krlDiagnostics` is properly pushed to `context.subscriptions`.
2.  **Analyze** `server/src/core.ts` to ensure the server is correctly listening to `onDidChangeContent` (or similar) and triggering the validation logic in `diagnostics.ts`.
3.  **Check** if there are any recent changes that might have disabled validation (e.g., a config flag defaulting to `false`, or an early return statement).
4.  **Fix** any bugs found. Ensure that:
    - Client-side diagnostics (simple regex checks) work.
    - Server-side diagnostics (deep validation) work.
5.  **Verify** that the communication between Client and Server is correct (Notification vs Request).

**Action:**
Edit the files directly to restore functionality.
