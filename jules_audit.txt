Audit the repository for Strict KRL Compliance and Logic Bugs.

Goals:
1. Strict ASCII Verification: confirm that NO Cyrillic functionality remains in identifiers. The logic should WARN on any non-ASCII character in code (but allow it in comments). Check both .src and .dat handlers.
2. FOLD Logic: Verify that diagnostics (errors/warnings) are correctly reported INSIDE ;FOLD ... ;ENDFOLD blocks.
3. Block Matching: Audit the new IF/ENDIF block highlighting logic for edge cases (e.g. nested blocks, mixed case).
4. General Logic Check: Scan for common KRL bugs we might have missed (e.g. unclosed strings, invalid enums).
