You are an expert **Product Manager and UI/UX Designer**.

**Objective:**
Rewrite the `README.md` to be a **Masterpiece of Documentation**. It must be professional, visual (HTML/Markdown mix), and "sell" the extension as the ultimate KRL tool.

**Key Narrative:**
"We didn't just port themes; we *engineered* them for Industrial Robotics."

**Structure & Content:**

1.  **Hero Header** (HTML Centered)
    - File: `logo.png`
    - Title: **KUKA KRL: The Ultimate Edition**
    - Badges: Version, Downloads, License (MIT/GPL), Sponsor.
    - Tagline: "Transform VS Code into a KRC4/KRC5 Powerhouse."

2.  **The "Why" (Pain Points)**
    - "Stop suffering in Notepad++."
    - "WorkVisual is clunky."
    - "Your eyes deserve better."

3.  **Feature Showcase (HTML Grid/Table preferred for alignment)**
    - **🎨 Engineered Aesthetics**:
        - "We integrated the legendary **[Bearded Theme](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-theme)** collection (GPL-3.0)."
        - **Critical Mod**: "We manually tuned all 67 themes. We removed distracting bold fonts from `FOLD` markers and optimized contrast for factory floor lighting."
    - **🛡️ Industrial-Grade Validation**:
        - "Zero-Error Policy."
        - Checks: Max name lengths (24 chars), Message keys (26 chars), Safe Velocities (`$VEL.CP`), Type safety.
    - **⚡ Intelligent Tools**:
        - I/O Signal Monitor (Side Panel).
        - Snippets for `Interrupts`, `SPS`, `EKI`.
        - 120+ System Variables auto-complete.

4.  **License & Credits (CRITICAL)**
    - **OpenKuka**: "Built on the knowledge of the [OpenKuka Community](https://github.com/OpenKuka/openkuka.github.io)."
    - **Bearded Theme**: "Themes adapted from Bearded Theme by BeardedBear (GPL-3.0). Usage rights preserved."

5.  **Installation Guide**
    - Simple 3 steps.

6.  **Settings Table**
    - Clean table explaining `krl.autoFold`, `krl.validateNonAscii`, etc.

**Visual Style:**
Use emojis 🎨, 🛡️, ⚡, 🔧, 📦. Use standard Markdown tables for data. Use `<h2>` centered headers if it looks better.

**Action:**
Write the file `README.md`.
